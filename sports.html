<h2 id="Basketball">Basketball</h2>
<p>The only major sport strictly of U.S. origin, basketball was invented by James Naismith (1861–1939) on or about December 1, 1891, at the International Young Men’s Christian Association (YMCA) Training School (now Springfield College), Springfield, Massachusetts, where Naismith was an instructor in physical education.

For that first game of basketball in 1891, Naismith used as goals two half-bushel peach baskets, which gave the sport its name.The students were enthusiastic.<span>After much running and shooting, William R. Chase made a midcourt shot—the only score in that historic contest.</span> Word spread about the newly invented game, and numerous associations wrote Naismith for a copy of the rules, which were published in the January 15, 1892.

<br>While basketball is competitively a winter sport, it is played on a 12-month basis—on summer playgrounds, in municipal, industrial, and church halls.
 </p>
 
 <ol>
<li>Basketball was first played with a soccer ball.</li>
<li> It was a hard sport because the rules were different back then.</li>
<li>Dribbling the ball was prohibited. </li>
<li> The three-pointer was not always included while playing.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="Baseball"> Baseball </h2>
<p> Baseball is game that is played with a bat,a ball, and gloves and it is between two teams including nine players each on a field with four white bases laid out in a diamond</p>

<p>It was nationalistic sentiment that helped to make baseball “America’s game.” In the quest to obtain greater cultural autonomy, Americans yearned for a sport they could claim as exclusively their own.</p>

<ul>
<li>Before tennis players used rackets, people would use the palm of their hands to hit the ball back and forth over the net.</li>
<li> Before yellow tennis balls, they were white.</li>
<li>The origin of the tennis term “love” is unknown. </li>
