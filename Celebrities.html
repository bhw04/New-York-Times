“I just want my life back.” Britney Spears told a Los Angeles judge in June during a rare court appearance.
The pop star said she had been drugged, compelled to work against her will and prevented from removing her birth control device under a legal arrangement that had ruled her life for more than 13 years.
“I truly believe this conservatorship is abusive,” Spears told the court. “I don’t feel like I can live a full life.”</p>
<p>Indeed the life and career of one of music’s biggest superstars, who enthralled audiences in the 1990s as she ascended to global stardom, has been at a standstill since 2008. That’s when, at age 26, Spears had her rights curtailed under a court-sanctioned conservatorship that put decisions about her fortune — and even her body — in the hands of others, including her father.</p>
