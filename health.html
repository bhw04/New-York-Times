<h1> The Covid-19 Pandemic</h1>
<p> The coronavirus pandemic has affected our lives, our economy and nearly every corner of the globe. More than 4.24 billion people worldwide have received a dose of a Covid-19 vaccine, equal to about 55.3 percent of the world population. However, there are stark gaps between richer and poorer nations. The United States has more than 770,000 known Covid-19 deaths, making the coronavirus pandemic the deadliest in American history.</p>
<h2 id="question"> Which vaccine is best? </h2>
<p> The good news is that all three vaccines approved for emergency use in the United States so far appear to be highly effective at preventing serious illness, hospitalization and death from Covid-19. Because the studies of these vaccines were conducted at different times, it’s tough to compare efficacy rates. Not only were the trials designed differently, but the virus itself has changed since the first studies were conducted. Even if you have a preference for which vaccine you want, public health experts encourage you to take the shot that is first available to you.</p>
<h2 id="question"> What if I lose my vaccine card? </h2> 
<p> Anyone who loses their card should return to where they were vaccinated for a new one. If you got your shot at a pharmacy, an employee can print out a new card from the patient’s electronic records. Vaccinations are also tracked by state health departments, so you can reach out to your state’s agency to get a replacement card, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p>
<h2 id="question"> What vaccine have been authorized for children? </h2> 
<p> The Food and Drug Administration so far has given emergency authorization only to the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for young people aged 12 to 17. The vaccine has been authorized for use in 16- and 17-year-olds since December, although in most states, eligibility for older teens was delayed until April. In May, children ages 12 to 15 became eligible for the Pfizer shot. Two other vaccines are likely to be given emergency authorization for children in the coming months. Moderna is testing its vaccine in 3,000 children ages 12 to 17 and may have results for that age group within weeks. Johnson & Johnson in April also began studying 12- to 17-year-olds.</p>
<h2 id="question"> Will my employer require vaccine?</h2>
<p>Employers do have the right to compel their workers to be vaccinated once a vaccine is formally approved. Many hospital systems, for example, require annual flu shots. But employees can seek exemptions based on medical reasons or religious beliefs. In such cases, employers are supposed to provide a “reasonable accommodation” — with a coronavirus vaccine, for example, a worker might be allowed to work if they wear a mask, or to work from home.</p> 
<h2 id="question">How long will the vaccine last?</h2>
<p>Vaccine makers already are working on developing booster shots that will target the variants, but it’s not clear how soon they might be needed. “In time, you’re going to see a recommendation for a booster,” said Dr. Peter J. Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston. “That booster will elevate everybody’s antibodies and increase durability. The booster will probably be configured to target the South African and Brazil variants.” It’s possible that Covid-19 vaccinations will become an annual event, just like the flu shot. Or it may be that the benefits of the vaccine last longer than a year. We have to wait to see how durable the protection from the vaccines is.</p>
