<h2> HOW DO YOU COVER THE WORLD? WE ASKED OUR REPORTERS.</h2>
<p>There was a time when the editors and reporters who covered the world for The New York Times worked for something called the “Foreign Desk.” And it made a certain sense.</p>

<p>The stories might have touched on all corners of the world, but for the most part, they were read in a single country: the United States. Top officials and intellectuals elsewhere would see what we wrote, but ordinary citizens generally did not.</p>

<p>None of that is true any longer. The Foreign Desk is long gone. It is now called the International Desk, a reflection not just of a changing mind-set at The Times, but of a fundamental change in the news organization itself.</p>

<p>We no longer just write about the whole world. We write for it. That was never clearer than this week, when we announced our one millionth digital subscription from outside the United States.</p>

<h2> New York Times; History &amp Facts </h2>

<p> The New York Times, morning daily newspaper published in New York City, long the newspaper of record in the United States and one of the world’s great newspapers. Its strength is in its editorial excellence; it has never been the largest newspaper in terms of circulation.</p>

<p>The Times was established in 1851 as a penny paper that would avoid sensationalism and report the news in a restrained and objective fashion. It enjoyed early success as its editors set a pattern for the future by appealing to a cultured, intellectual readership instead of a mass audience.</p>
